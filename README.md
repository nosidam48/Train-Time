# Train-Time
### A train scheduling app using a Firebase database

The user can add a train and include the first train time of the day and the amount of time between each train.

Hit the "Add Train" button to generate the new train in the list. 

The new information will include the time of the next train and how many minutes until it will arrive.

Remove trains from the page (and the firebase database) with the remove button.
